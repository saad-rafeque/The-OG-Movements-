# Eye Gesture Control (Lean, No-Speech Build)

A lightweight and real-time eye-gesture control system built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python. This project allows users to control the mouse cursor and perform click actions with eye movements and blinks. Itâ€™s designed for responsiveness and accuracy with low-latency input.

###  Features

-  **Eye movement detection**: Control left and right movements of the cursor using eye gestures.
-  **Blink detection**: Click the mouse by blinking.
-  **Long blink detection**: Pause and resume command execution with a long blink.
-  **Fast and responsive**: Optimized for low-latency and real-time feedback.
-  **Debug window**: Provides real-time feedback on eye gestures and system status.

###  Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-saad-rafeque/The-OG-Movements.git
cd The-OG-Movements
```
#### 2. Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run the script:
Make sure your camera is connected and positioned correctly for best results.
Run the Python script to start the eye gesture control:

```bash
python main.py
```


#### 4. Customize Settings:
You can adjust various settings in the script, including camera resolution, blink thresholds, and movement speed by editing the USER SETTINGS section of the script.

### Notes
- Press Q to quit the application at any time.

- The script expects a working webcam and proper lighting for best performance.

- Calibration data is saved per session. Ensure proper calibration by following the on-screen instructions.

### Troubleshooting
-  "Cannot open camera": Make sure your webcam is connected, or update the camera index in the script (CAM_INDEX).

-  Low performance: Lower the frame rate (FPS_LIMIT) or resolution (CAM_WIDTH, CAM_HEIGHT) to improve performance.

### Customization
This project can be customized to support additional gestures, or even integrated into other software, such as media players or custom applications.
